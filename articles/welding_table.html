    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <p>I designed and built a full welding table (4 m × 1 m) entirely by myself to support the assembly of my kart-cross chassis. 
      The table was fabricated from raw steel profiles using only basic tools — an angle grinder, a drill, and a welding machine. 
      This project required designing a rigid and flat structure, preparing and cutting all profiles, welding with accuracy,
       and ensuring alignment over the full length. It allowed me to practice hands-on fabrication,
        improve my welding and assembly skills, and gain experience in building my own workshop equipment.</p>
